## What Is Kettle
So, you're interested in Kettle, are you? First of all, what *is* Kettle? Kettle is an open-source, minimal, 64-bit bootloader, kernel, and operating system.
## Kettle's Goal
- Create a set of standards for Operating System development.
- Define standard structures Operating Systems will follow such as file system layout, executable layout, and dynamic linking.
- Provide a platform in which all executables will work the same on all Operating Systems and platforms alike.
- Provide a standard by which operating systems (like Linux) provide extensions for interacting with other parts of the operating system not added by the kernel, such as providing a desktop API.
